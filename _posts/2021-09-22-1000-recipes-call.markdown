On August 27, 2019, the conan-center-index repository was created, and Lasote
[uploaded the first recipe](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/commit/b39b3889147fd84643e1b65a433934343eb70ff4):
zlib.

Almost exactly two years later, SpaceIM
[uploaded libsamplerate](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/commit/9bc281eac017bd33a5cf221e289a0a10ad0ffdfb),
and Conan Center officially reached **the astounding number of 1.000 recipes**.

Since its inception, Conan Center has grown a lot. Almost 400 contributors, 10,000 commits, 5,500
pull requests, and, most of all, an incredible community helping us every day to make it even bigger
and better.

Of course, that’s something we want to celebrate. And we’d like you to join us!

So on Thursday, September 30 we’re going to host an online event for all Conan Center contributors
and users. We will talk about how big Conan Center has become, and what can we expect from it in the
future.

### Event Activities

* Welcome and Introduction
* Short Presentation - Conan Center: Much More Than Recipes
* Big raffle: if you're a Conan Center contributor you can win a Nintendo Switch!
