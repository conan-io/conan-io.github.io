We're excited to unveil the new ``finalize()`` method in Conan, a way of allowing users to customize packages locally while preserving their immutability
in the Conan cache. This feature is crucial for scenarios where modifications
are required on the local machine, such as generating configuration files or
managing execution-generated files like Python's *pycache*.

## Why ``finalize()`` matters?

Package immutability is a key principle in Conan, ensuring consistency and
reliability across various environments. The ``finalize()`` method respects this
principle while enabling local adjustments, maintaining the integrity of the
original package stored in the Conan cache.

Common use cases for ``finalize()`` include:

- **Ensuring cache integrity**: Handling files generated during package execution (e.g., *pycache*) in a way that doesn't alter the original package.
- **Local modifications**: Creating or adjusting configuration files necessary for the package to function correctly on the local machine which can't be achieved at package creation time.


### How ``finalize()`` works

The ``finalize()`` method is invoked after a package is installed in the local
cache but before it is used by consumers. This allows you to implement logic to
locally copy or generate files without affecting the original package. For
instance:

```py
from conan import ConanFile
from conan.tools.files import copy
import os

class Package(ConanFile):
    def package(self):
        copy(self, "*", src=self.source_folder, dst=os.path.join(self.package_folder, "bin"))

    def finalize(self):
        copy(self, "*", src=self.immutable_package_folder, dst=self.package_folder)
```

In this example we introduce a new class attribute, ``immutable_package_folder``.
This attribute will always point to the original ``self.package_folder`` that is used in the ``package()`` method.

When a package which declares a ``finalize()`` method is consumed, its
``package_folder`` will no longer point to the previous path, but
a new path which follows this structure in the cache
``\<conan\_cache\>/p/b/\<build\_id\>/f``. This folder will not be tracked for
integrity so any alteration on this path will be transparent for Conan and will always be kept local for the current user.

This is why in the ``finalize()`` method we must ensure that all the needed files
installed in the ``immutable_package_folder`` are also **copied** or **symlinked**
to the new ``package_folder``.  
And that is what the example is doing in the last line.

> **Note**: the ``finalize()`` method will only run once per *package\_id*. This means that, if the package is used multiple times, the ``finalize()`` method will only run the first time, so different consumers will use the same *final folder*.

> **Warning**: packages can't change its "binary" compatibility or footprint in any way. Otherwise, other packages consuming this one will not work when uploaded and reused, because they will depend on a binary that is not uploaded. This feature is intended for customizations of runtime or build utilities to correctly consume the package, build against it and use it at runtime.

> **Warning**: symlinking in Conan recipes is not a recommended practice due to its bad portability, specially for Windows ecosystem.
Even though in special and controlled cases symlinking could be useful to avoid bloated libraries duplication, users should use it under their own risk!

### Examples

#### Meson cache integrity

Traditionally, maintaining cache integrity during package uploads, especially
for tools like *Meson*, required disabling Python bytecode generation to
prevent cache corruption. However, using ``finalize()``, you can keep Python's
caching efficiency intact while ensuring that cache integrity is preserved.
Let's see in deep detail with a typical workflow:

1. A package is installed
2. The package is tested locally in order to verify the changes are correct. During this step, files could be generated in the Conan local cache package folder. In the case of *Meson*, ``.pyc``  
3. Upload the modified package to a remote. Conan will perform an integrity check on the local cache before uploading the package when called with the ``-–check`` argument. This would historically fail because the cache is now “dirty”. Those ``.pyc`` files have been created automatically in the ``package_folder`` and Conan caught the mismatch.

This is a simplified version of the current *Meson* package method, where Python bytecode generation has been disabled:

```py
def package(self):
    # Create wrapper functions
    save(self, os.path.join(self.package_folder, "bin", "meson"), textwrap.dedent("""\
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        meson_dir=$(dirname "$0")
        export PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
        exec "$meson_dir/meson.py" "$@"
    """))
```

This was a valid solution in order to ensure cache integrity inside the Conan
cache. Remember that this problem did not only affect *Meson* maintainers but
every user who has used the *Meson* build system as a dependency. Without this
tweak, performing a quick ``conan cache check-integrity "meson"`` will fail.

But this still was not a perfect solution as it threw all python caching
efficiency out of the window. This is one of the main reasons for implementing
the ``finalize()`` method. Let's see how could we modify the *Meson* package in order
to keep Python's efficiency and cache integrity intact:

&nbsp;1. First we could get rid of the ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE`` environment variable because we want python to generate ``.pyc`` files:

```py
def package(self):
    # Create wrapper functions
    save(self, os.path.join(self.package_folder, "bin", "meson"), textwrap.dedent("""\
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        meson_dir=$(dirname "$0")
        exec "$meson_dir/meson.py" "$@"
    """))
```

&nbsp;2. We need to create a ``finalize()`` method which will copy all contents of the ``immutable_package_folder`` to the final and isolated ``package_folder``

```py
def finalize(self):
    copy(self, "*", src=self.immutable_package_folder, dst=self.package_folder)
```

As explained above, in the context of the ``finalize()`` method the consumer's ``self.package_folder`` will now aim to the *final folder*.
This will be the case for all its dependants and its own ``package_info()`` method.

This way, making use of this new method, we can completely isolate the *Meson*
application, making sure that the cache integrity will now be kept intact.

#### Custom configuration files within package scope

The ``finalize()`` method is also beneficial for packages that need to generate
custom configuration files locally. For example, a package can use ``finalize()``
to create a ``whoami.txt`` file containing the current user's name, ensuring this
file is present without altering the original package.

Let's use a very simplified example located at [examples2 repository](https://github.com/conan-io/examples2)

&nbsp;1. Clone the ``example2`` repository:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:conan-io/example2
$ cd examples2/examples/conanfile/finalize/finalize_method
```

&nbsp;2. In ``src/main.cpp`` we have a basic program that reads a file called ``whoami.txt`` and prints the contents to the standard output

```c++
std::ifstream in("whoami.txt", std::ios_base::in);
std::cout << in.rdbuf() << '\n';
```

&nbsp;3. In the ``conanfile.py`` we highlight the ``finalize()`` method:

```py
def finalize(self):
    copy(self, "*", src=self.immutable_package_folder, dst=self.package_folder)
    save(self, os.path.join(self.package_folder, "bin", "whoami.txt"), getpass.getuser())
```

- As we can see, the first line will copy all contents from the ``immutable_package_folder`` (the executable itself) to the *final folder* (remember, the path with this pattern in the cache `\<conan_cache\>/p/b/\<build_id\>/f`).  
- But we are also creating a file called ``whoami.txt`` with the result of invoking ``getpass.getuser()``, which is the pythonic way of getting the current user. Note that this would not be possible to do until now in the ``package`` method as we want the ``whoami`` results of the running machine, not the packaging one.

&nbsp;4. Create the package and observe the traces:

```sh
$ conan create .
...
whoisconan/1.0: Calling package()
...
whoisconan/1.0: Package folder /Users/conan/.conan2/p/b/whoisf8485f8a03c9b/p
whoisconan/1.0: Calling finalize()
whoisconan/1.0: Finalized folder /Users/conan/.conan2/p/b/whoisf8485f8a03c9b/f
```

As we can see, after the ``package()`` method is invoked, the ``finalize()`` method will be run, copying the contents of the ``/p`` folder to ``/f`` folder.

&nbsp;5. Go to finalized folder path

```sh
$ cd /Users/conan/.conan2/p/b/whoisf8485f8a03c9b/f/bin
```

&nbsp;6. Run the application and observe the result

```sh
$ ./whoisconan
conan
```

As we can see, the executable will perform a basic ``cat`` of the content of the ``whoami.txt`` file located next to the executable.

This example shows how the ``finalize()`` method allows the package to
customize files according to the local environment, or any other kind of
modifications needed, while keeping the Conan cache pristine and without altering the
``package_id``.

### Accessing folders of packages which has the ``finalize()`` method

The main idea of the ``finalize()`` method is to redirect the ``package_folder`` in a transparent way to the consumers. 

When a consumer accesses its ``package_folder`` dependency, it will work as always. This folder will contain the contents needed to work but also ensure that any local changes do not impact the immutable package stored in the cache. 

Let's dive into an example of accessing the folders of a package which has a ``finalize()`` method in it.

&nbsp;1. To simplify things, let's use the ``finalize_consume`` example in the example2 repository:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:conan-io/example2
$ cd examples2/examples/conanfile/finalize/finalize_consume
```

This folder contains two packages, the dependency one which has a ``finalize()`` method, and the consumer which will just print the contents of its dependency folders.

&nbsp;2. Create the dependency package

```sh
$ conan create dependency
...
dependency/1.0: Calling package()
dependency/1.0: package(): Packaged 2 '.txt' files: file2.txt, file1.txt
...
dependency/1.0: Package folder /Users/conan/.conan2/p/b/depen856e3d9c06c1f/p
dependency/1.0: Calling finalize()
dependency/1.0: Running finalize method in /Users/conan/.conan2/p/b/depen856e3d9c06c1f/f
dependency/1.0: Finalized folder /Users/conan/.conan2/p/b/depen856e3d9c06c1f/f
dependency/1.0: Running package_info method in /Users/conan/.conan2/p/b/depen856e3d9c06c1f/f
```

Two files (``file1.txt`` and ``file2.txt``) were packaged in the original ``package_folder`` (``.conan2/p/b/depen856e3d9c06c1f/p``)   
We can also see that in the ``package_info`` method's context, the ``package_folder`` points to the *final folder* (``.conan2/p/b/depen856e3d9c06c1f/f``). This is going to be from now on the real path when accessing its ``package_folder``.

&nbsp;3. Create the consumer package:

```sh
$ conan create consumer
...
consumer/1.0: Calling generate()
...
consumer/1.0: Running generate method
consumer/1.0: Dependency package_folder: /Users/conan/.conan2/p/b/depen856e3d9c06c1f/f
consumer/1.0: Content in dependency package_folder:
['file1.txt']
consumer/1.0: Dependency immutable_package_folder: /Users/conan/.conan2/p/b/depen856e3d9c06c1f/p
consumer/1.0: Content in dependency immutable_package_folder:
['file2.txt', 'file1.txt', 'conanmanifest.txt', 'conaninfo.txt']
...
consumer/1.0: Generating the package
consumer/1.0: Packaging in folder /Users/conan/.conan2/p/b/consuea78f76f2c500/p
```

As described above, when the consumer accesses its dependency ``package_folder`` 

```py
self.dependencies["dependency"].package_folder
```

The obtained path will be the *final folder* and not the typical ``/p`` path (the immutable one).  
We can also appreciate that the content of the ``package_folder`` just contains what we explicitly have copied in the ``finalize`` method on the ``dependency`` package.

> **Note**: in most of the cases, consumers will never need to access ``immutable_package_folder``. 

> **Note**: as soon as a recipe has defined the ``finalize()`` method, the resulting ``package_folder`` will point to the *final folder* (the one ended with ``/f``). This means that even if the method is empty, the redirection will be performed.

#### Why ``immutable_package_folder``?

As the original ``package_folder`` gets overridden by the *final folder*, without any other property, there could be no way to access the original package folder for a dependency or even inside the ``package_info()`` method. 

This feature has been created with the idea of never needing to access the original ``package_folder``. Consumers should never need to know which folder (the one ending with ``/p`` or the one ending with ``/f``) a dependency is using. This will always be transparent for the consumers.

Nevertheless, there might be a few reasons for using the new attribute.

Remember the [last post](https://blog.conan.io/2024/07/09/Introducing-vendoring-packages.html) where we talked about the new "vendoring feature". We explained that the user who wants to vendor a package is fully responsible for correctly encapsulating the needed components of their dependencies inside the vendored package.  
There might be some reasons in which, when vendoring, we may want to check if a dependency has a ``finalize()`` method. This check could be easily achieved by comparing ``dependency.immutable_package_folder == dependency.package_folder``. If they are not the same, it means that the ``dependency.package_folder`` is an isolated one and not the original one.   
In that case, users could decide to vendor the contents not from the ``package_folder`` but from ``immutable_package_folder``, or both...

`immutable_package_folder` will also be serialize in the output of `conan graph info`, which allows for advanced usages.

### Conclusion

The ``finalize()`` method is a great enhancement in Conan, offering a flexible
way to manage local customizations while ensuring the original package's
immutability. Whether you need to handle execution-generated files or create
custom configurations, ``finalize()`` provides a robust solution that preserves
both performance and cache integrity. This method is a powerful addition to
Conan's toolset, enabling developers to tailor packages to their local
environment without compromising the consistency that is critical for reliable
package management.

Stay tuned for more updates and, as always, happy packaging with Conan!
