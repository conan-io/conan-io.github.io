We are pleased to announce that Conan 1.50 has been released and brings some significant
new features and bug fixes. We have added the ``CMakeToolchain.cache_variables`` to
apply them via ``-D`` arguments in the build helper. Also, we have improved the XCodeDeps
support for components. Finally, we continue fixing things and porting tools so that the
recipe syntax is compatible with Conan 2.0.

## New CMakeToolchain.cache_variables

Since this version, the [CMakeToolchain
generator](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/cmake/cmaketoolchain.html#cmaketoolchain)
provides an attribute to define CMake cache-variables. This variables will be stored in
the *CMakePresets.json* file (at the *cacheVariables* in the *configurePreset*) and will
be applied with ``-D`` arguments when calling ``cmake.configure`` using the Conan [CMake
build
helper](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/cmake/cmake.html#conan-cmake-build-helper).
Let's see an example:

```python
...
class MylibConan(ConanFile):
    ...
    def generate(self):
        tc = CMakeToolchain(self)
        tc.cache_variables["foo"] = True
        tc.cache_variables["foo2"] = False
        tc.cache_variables["var"] = "23"
        tc.generate()

    def build(self):
        cmake = CMake(self)
        cmake.configure()
        cmake.build()
```

When ``cmake.configure()`` is invoked, it will pass the following arguments to CMake:

```bash
cmake -G ... -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="/pathto/conan_toolchain.cmake" ... -Dfoo="ON" -Dfoo2="OFF" -Dvar="23" ...
```

As you can see, the booleans in the recipe are automatically translated to ``ON`` and
``OFF`` values in CMake. 

## Improvements in XCodeDeps

Since we introduced XcodeDeps in [Conan
1.42](http://localhost:4000/2021/11/10/New-conan-release-1-42.html), we have been
gradually improving this generator. Since Conan 1.49 this generator creates separate
*.xcconfig* files for packages that have components, now this release adds some internal
optimizations that make it more efficient to consume these type of packages. The
components support makes it possible to select just specific components instead of adding
the whole package. For example, if you are depending directly on a package that has
components such as [boost](https://conan.io/center/boost) but you just want to use the
**boost** **filesystem** and **chrono** components, you can easily do this in your recipe
in the ``generate()`` method. Let's see an example:


```python
import textwrap
from conan import ConanFile
from conan.tools.apple import XcodeDeps
from conan.tools.files import save


class MyappConan(ConanFile):
    name = "myapp"
    version = "1.0"

    ...
    
    def generate(self):
        deps = XcodeDeps(self)
        deps.generate()
        # overwrite the generated conandeps.xcconfig
        # with just the components
        # we want to use instead the whole package
        component_deps = textwrap.dedent("""
            #include "conan_boost_filesystem.xcconfig"
            #include "conan_boost_chrono.xcconfig"
            """)
        save(self, "conandeps.xcconfig", component_deps)
```

## Advances in providing a 2.0 compatible recipe syntax

We continue improving the syntax compatibility with Conan 2.0, some
relevant changes are:

- Create ``self.info.clear()`` as [an
  alias](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/migrating_to_2.0/recipes.html#the-package-id-method)
  of ``self.info.header_only()`` that will disappear in Conan 2.0.
- Allow options having ``["ANY"]`` [as a
  list](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/migrating_to_2.0/recipes.html#any-special-value)
- Ported all [C++ standard related
  tools](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/build.html) from 2.0 to
  1.50

For more detailed information on how to migrate your recipes to be compatible with Conan
2.0, please check the [migration guide](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/conan_v2.html).


## Advances in the documentation for Conan 2.0

We would like to talk a bit about Conan 2.0. As you may know, the first Conan 2.0 beta is
already out. You can install it using *pip*:

```bash
$ pip install conan --pre
```

We have done an effort lately to complete the [documentation for the new Conan major
version](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/). Although the documentation for 2.0 is still in
"draft" state, some sections are practically complete. There are some differences in how
the Conan 1.X and Conan 2.0 documentation is structured. Let's see the most relevant
sections of the documentation for Conan 2.0:

### The tutorial section

This [new section](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/tutorial.html) gives a practical hands-on
introduction to the most important Conan features. The objective is to learn these
features step by step. This section is divided into three sub-sections:

- Consuming packages: this part, that is already completed shows how to build your
projects using Conan to manage your dependencies starting from a simple project that uses
the Zlib library. In this section, you will learn things like [using
tool_requires](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/tutorial/consuming_packages/use_tools_as_conan_packages.html),
what [Conan settings and
options](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/tutorial/consuming_packages/different_configurations.html)
are, how to consume using a
[conanfile.py](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/tutorial/consuming_packages/the_flexibility_of_conanfile_py.html),
and how you can
[cross-compile](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/tutorial/consuming_packages/cross_building_with_conan.html)
your applications with Conan using the dual profile approach. 

- Creating packages: this section is half finished and shows how to create Conan packages
  using a Conan recipe. We begin by [creating a basic Conan
  recipe](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/tutorial/creating_packages/create_your_first_package.html)
  to package a simple C++ library that you can scaffold using the conan new command and
  then we begin adding features to it explaining how the different methods of the Conan
  recipe work. Topics such as [how to retrieve the source
  code](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/tutorial/creating_packages/handle_sources_in_packages.html)
  from external repositories and apply patches, [customise the
  toolchain](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/tutorial/creating_packages/preparing_the_build.html),
  how binary compatibility works and how to package the files of your Conan packages. The
  last part of the tutorial is about the peculiarities of different types of Conan
  packages like [header-only
  packages](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/tutorial/creating_packages/other_types_of_packages/header_only_packages.html),
  [packages for pre-built
  binaries](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/tutorial/creating_packages/other_types_of_packages/package_prebuilt_binaries.html)
  or [tool requires
  packages](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/tutorial/creating_packages/other_types_of_packages/tool_requires_packages.html).

- Versioning and Continuous Integration: this section is not written yet. We will provide
  some "best practices" for using Conan in your CI here.

### The examples section

This section collects examples of some relevant use cases for Conan features, things like:

- Creating [custom Conan
  commands](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/examples/extensions/commands/clean/custom_command_clean_revisions.html)
- [Using
  CMakePresets](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/examples/tools/cmake/cmake_toolchain/build_project_cmake_presets.html)
  to build your project.
- Best practices for [patching the source
  code](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/examples/tools/files/patches/patch_sources.html)
- How to [cross-build for
  Android](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/examples/cross_build/android/ndk.html) and
  [integrate Conan in Android
  Studio](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/examples/cross_build/android/android_studio.html).

### The reference section

[This section](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/reference.html) will collect the reference of
public classes and methods you can use in your Conan recipes. One significant section of
the reference is the one documenting the Conan API. Although the development of this API
is still in progress and is not stable yet, we plan to document the whole Conan API for
Conan 2.0 so that you can use that in your projects. One relevant example, regarding this, 
is [the one that creates a Conan custom
command](https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/examples/extensions/commands/clean/custom_command_clean_revisions.html)
to clean the Conan cache and uses some methods of this API.
