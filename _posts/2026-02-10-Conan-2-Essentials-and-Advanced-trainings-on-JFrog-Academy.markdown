The training is composed of **29 video lessons** in total, divided into **7
modules** across the two paths: **16 lessons** in Essentials (3 modules) and
**13 lessons** in Advanced (4 modules).

## Conan 2 Essentials

The [**Conan 2
Essentials**](https://academy.jfrog.com/path/conan-cc-package-manager) path
covers the fundamentals of using and creating packages with Conan 2. It is
intended for developers with little or no Conan experience and will give you the
essential knowledge to start working with Conan in your day-to-day work.

**Module 1: Fundamentals of Package Usage**
Master the fundamentals of consuming C++ packages with Conan 2. You will learn
CMake integration, cross-compilation, and security auditing so you can
confidently use Conan in your projects.

**Module 2: Package Creation and Uploading**
Go through the complete lifecycle of Conan 2 packaging: writing recipes,
managing dependencies, configuring binary compatibility, and uploading packages
to remote repositories such as Artifactory.

**Module 3: Advanced Package Creation Scenarios**
Expand your packaging skills with specialized scenarios: creating recipes for
header-only libraries, packaging pre-compiled binaries, and managing build tools
with **tool_requires**.

## Conan 2 Advanced

The [**Conan 2 Advanced**](https://academy.jfrog.com/path/conan-2-advanced) path
is for users who already have a solid grasp of Conan 2 basics, including those
who have gone through Essentials. It focuses on local development workflows,
dependency management, extensibility, and advanced aspects of the binary model.

**Module 1: Developing Packages Locally**
Learn the standard package development flow and how to use **editable mode** so
you can edit and consume packages at the same time without constantly
re-packaging.

**Module 2: The Dependency Graph**  
Tackle dependency management in depth: distinguish between package types,
implement test-specific requirements, and ensure build reproducibility with
advanced versioning and **lockfiles**.

**Module 3: Extensibility & Customization**
Unlock Conan's full potential by customizing its behavior with extensions,
writing custom commands and hooks, using deployers for artifact extraction, and
reusing recipe logic with **python_requires**.

**Module 4: Advanced Binary Model**
Deepen your understanding of the binary model: extend configuration settings and
define custom binary compatibility rules so your packages integrate seamlessly
across different environments.

## Start Learning Today

Both paths are **free**, **self-paced**, and available on JFrog Academy. If you
