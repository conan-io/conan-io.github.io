Conan 1.42 brings several significant new features. We have added a new [conan.tool.XcodeDeps
generator](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/apple.html), which supports
multiple configurations and easy integration with the Xcode IDE. Also, Conan now comes with OSX
Monterey support in its default settings. Finally, Conan now generates a script to deactivate all the
aggregated environments as it did for activating them.


## New XcodeDeps multi-config generator

The [new XcodeDeps](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/apple.html) generator
allows easy integration with the Xcode IDE. It supports multiple configurations, so if you install
the packages for different *Release* and *Debug* configurations, you can switch between those two
configurations in the IDE and the dependency information is updated to match the active configuration
requirements.

Let's see how you can use the files generated by Conan in your **Xcode** project. Imagine you have a
simple Xcode project with this structure:

```
.
└── MyApplication
    ├── MyApplication
    │   ├── conanfile.txt
    │   └── main.cpp
    └── MyApplication.xcodeproj
```

With a *conanfile.txt* like this, with just [fmt](https://conan.io/center/fmt) as dependency and
adding the *XcodeDeps* generator:

```
[requires]
fmt/8.0.1
[generators]
XcodeDeps
```

You can install the dependencies for both *Release* and *Debug* configurations:

```
$ conan install . -s build_type=Debug
$ conan install . -s build_type=Release
```

Conan will install all the required packages and generate several **.xcconfig** files with all
the information about those dependencies. In this case, as *ftm* is a library with no transitive
dependencies, the generated files are:

```
conan_fmt.xcconfig
conan_fmt_debug_x86_64.xcconfig
conan_fmt_release_x86_64.xcconfig
conan_fmt_vars_debug_x86_64.xcconfig
conan_fmt_vars_release_x86_64.xcconfig
conandeps.xcconfig
```

Those files define information like where to search the headers of the dependencies, compiler
flags, the location for the libraries, frameworks needed to compile the application, etc., for both
*Debug* and *Release* configurations. It will also generate one single file (**conandeps.xcconfig**)
aggregating all the files for the direct dependencies (just *fmt* in this case).

Go to your **Xcode** project, click on the project and select **Add files to…**

<p class="centered">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/post_images/2021-11-10/1-add_files_to_project.png" align="center" alt="Project, Add files to..."/>
</p>

Add those files to your project:

<p class="centered">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/post_images/2021-11-10/2-select_files.png" align="center" alt="Select xcconfig files to add"/>
</p>

Click on the project again. In the Info/Configurations section, choose **conandeps** for Release and
Debug.

<p class="centered">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/post_images/2021-11-10/3-set_config_files.png" align="center" alt="Set configuration files for Debug and Release"/>
</p>

Now build as usual. **Xcode** will link with the information that Conan provides for the configuration
that's active.

<p class="centered">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/post_images/2021-11-10/4-build_project.png" align="center" alt="Build the project"/>
</p>

Besides this new generator, we now support **macOS Monterey** in the default settings that come with
the Conan installation.

## Deactivate aggregated environments easily 

We keep improving the Conan tools for managing environments. Up to this point, the
environments were grouped for activation in the `conanbuild` and `conanrun` scripts but no aggregated
script was generated for deactivation. From this version, a new `deactivate_conanbuild` or
`deactivate_conanrun` is generated together with those files to deactivate all the environments at
once.


Also, please note that we made some changes to the environment classes. Now, [Environment](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/env/environment.html) is just a generic class used by others like the [conan.tools.gnu](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/gnu.html#conan-tools-gnu) autotools helpers, and the [VirtualBuildEnv](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/env/virtualbuildenv.html#conan-tools-env-virtualbuildenv) and [VirtualRunEnv](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/env/virtualrunenv.html#conan-tools-env-virtualrunenv) generator. If you want to use it, a specialization for the current context EnvVars object needs to be obtained from it with the [vars()](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/env/environment.html#obtaining-environment-variables) method. Let's see an example:

```python
from conans import ConanFile
from conan.tools.env import Environment

class Pkg(ConanFile):

    def generate(self):
        env1 = Environment()
        env1.define("env_name", "env1")
        env1.vars(self).save_script("env1_launcher")
        env2 = Environment()
        env2.define("env_name", "env2")
        env2.vars(self).save_script("env2_launcher")
        env3 = Environment()
        env2.define("env_name", "env3")
        env2.vars(self).save_script("env3_launcher")
```

Note the change in syntax compared to the [previous
implementation](https://blog.conan.io/2021/10/14/New-conan-release-1-41.html). Now, after running  a
`conan install .`, these files are generated:

```
├── conanbuild.sh
├── deactivate_conanbuild.sh
├── env1_launcher.sh
├── env2_launcher.sh
└── env3_launcher.sh
```

You can use `conanbuild.sh` to activate all the environments at once and `deactivate_conanbuild.sh`
to deactivate them in the correct order. Please [check the
documentation](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/env.html) for more
information about this topic.
