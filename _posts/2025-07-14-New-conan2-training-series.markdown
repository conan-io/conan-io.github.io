After months of dedicated work, we are thrilled to launch the new [**Conan 2
Essentials**](https://academy.jfrog.com/conan-2-essentials) course, which is now
fully available.

This new course has been created from the ground up to cover the fundamental
features and best practices of **Conan 2**. It will provide you with the
essential knowledge needed to start working with the tool effectively, whether
you are a new user or migrating from a previous version.

## A Hands-On, Free, and Self-Paced Course

This course is designed to be a practical learning experience. There's a
dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-training2) with
the source code that you will use throughout the lessons to apply the concepts
with **hands-on examples**, allowing you to experiment firsthand with the
features of Conan 2.

The course is **completely free** and available for you to take at your own
pace, with no schedules or deadlines.

## What Will You Learn in 'Conan 2 Essentials'?

The course consists of **16 video lessons**, totaling **over two hours
of content**. It follows a logical progression, starting with the
most common scenario: **consuming packages** to build a simple application with
CMake. From there, you'll explore the basic anatomy of a **conanfile.py** and
other fundamental topics like **settings,** **options,** **profiles,** Conan's
**PackageID** system, and even **cross-compilation**. The journey then continues into
the core of **package creation**, where you'll build your own libraries, **manage
dependencies**, and finally learn how to **use and upload your packages to an
Artifactory repository**, giving you enough hands-on experience to startworking
with Conan as part of your daily development process.

## Start Learning Today!

Don't wait any longer to modernize your C++ dependency management skills. The
course is complete and waiting for you.

## What's Next? The Advanced Course is on its Way

While our focus today is on the "Essentials" course launch, we want to let you
know that we are already working on the next chapter: **Conan 2 Advanced**. This
course will delve into more complex scenarios and advanced features. You will
learn to streamline local development workflows with editable packages, master
advanced versioning and lockfiles, and unlock Conan's full potential through its
extensibility and customization features. We will be releasing lessons
incrementally over the coming months, aiming to have the full course ready by
the **end of this year**.

As always, your feedback is crucial to us. If you have any questions or
suggestions during the course, please don't hesitate to open an issue in the
[Conan Training GitHub repository](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-training2).

We hope you enjoy the new content!
