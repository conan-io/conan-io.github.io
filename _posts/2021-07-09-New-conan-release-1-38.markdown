---

Conan 1.38 is already here and comes with lots of new features and some bug fixes. As we have
explained in previous posts we are paving the way to Conan 2.0, so most of the new features have to
do with that. We have added a new `conanfile.dependencies` model, using a dictionary that will return
information about the dependencies and may be used both directly in recipe or indirectly to create
custom build integrations and generators. Also, now conan profiles support `jinja2` syntax which
provides the abilities of reading environment variables, using platform information and much more. We
have added a new `cmake_layout()` layout helper to define a multi-platform CMake layout that will
work for different generators (ninja, xcode, visual, unix), and is multi-config. There is also a new
`--conf` argument to provide command line support for the new
[conf](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/config_files/global_conf.html) system. Finally, we
have added a new `PkgConfigDeps` generator that will replace the existing `pkg_config` generator. 

## New `conanfile.dependencies` model

Starting in 1.38, conan recipes will provide access to their dependencies through the
`self.dependencies` attribute. The purpouse of this interface is mainly developing new build system
integrations and is extensively used by conan generators like `CMakeDeps` or `MSBuildDeps` to
generate the necessary files for the build. It is also possible to access this interface from the
recipe like this:

```python
class MypkgConan(ConanFile):
    name = "mypkg"
    version = "1.0"
    requires = "libwebsockets/4.2.0"

    def generate(self):
        libwebsockets = self.dependencies["libwebsockets"]
        self.output.info(f"{libwebsockets.ref.version}")       
        self.output.info(f"{libwebsockets.ref.revision}")
        self.output.info(f"{libwebsockets.settings.arch}")
        self.output.info(f"{', '.join([dep.ref.name for dep in libwebsockets.dependencies.values()])}")
```

As you can see we access can get information about the conan reference, settings and even the
information about the dependencies of a specific dependency. Please, note that this information is
**read only** and that it can only be used in methods called after the full dependency graph has been
computed. For more details about this, please [check the
documentation](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/dependencies.html#dependencies-interface).

This new model will also allow to iterate dependencies of a recipe in a dict-like fashion, the key of
that dictionary will contain the specifiers of the relation between the current recipe and the
dependency. At the moment it can tell us if the dependency is a direct requirement (through the
`.direct` property) or if it's a *build_require* (returned by the `.build` property). Based on these
values there are some helper properties to iterate all the dependencies and filter the ones we want.
For example if you want to list all the direct requirements for the dependency you could call to
`self.dependencies.host` and get all direct and transitive requirements that are not *build_require*.

```python
class MypkgConan(ConanFile):
    name = "mypkg"
    version = "1.0"
    requires = "libwebsockets/4.2.0"

    def generate(self):
        trans_deps = self.dependencies.host
        self.output.info(f"transitive deps: {', '.join([dep.ref.name for dep in trans_deps.values()])}")
```

The recipe above should output for example:

```bash
mypkg/1.0: Calling generate()
mypkg/1.0: transitive deps: libwebsockets, openssl
```

Please refer to the [Conan
documentation](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/dependencies.html#iterating-dependencies)
for more details on what helper properties are available.

## Support for `jinja2` syntax in conan profiles

After many users requests on having more powerful profiles and doing some exploratory attemps with
other implementations we have finally decided to experimentally provide Conan profiles to support
`jinja2` templating syntax. This provides Conan profiles with some very useful capabilities. The only
thing to be done is naming the profile with the `.jinja` extension. Let's see some of those
capabilities:

* Using environment variables in profiles. Python `os` module is added to the render context so we
  can read environment variables using pure Python syntax. Also you can define variables for using
  later.

        {% raw %}
        {% set build_type = os.getenv("MY_BUILD_TYPE") %}
        [settings]
        build_type = {{ build_type }}
        {% endraw %}

* Access to platform information. Python `platform` module is also added to the render context so we
  could set settings depending on the operating system we are running Conan into.

        {% raw %}
        [settings]
        os = {{ {"Darwin": "Macos"}.get(platform.system(), platform.system()) }}
        {% endraw %}

* Access to the current profile directory using the variable `profile_dir`.

You have all the information related to this feature in the [Conan
Documentation](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/profiles.html#profile-templates).
