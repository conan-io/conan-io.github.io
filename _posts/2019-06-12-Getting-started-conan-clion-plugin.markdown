Great news for all CLion coders!

Some weeks ago we officially launched the integration with the CLion IDE with the
[Conan Clion Plugin](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-clion-plugin).

The plugin allows to seamlessly use the power of Conan to retrieve the dependencies for you project, configure the right paths to the
libraries and the appropriate flags to link with all of them.

Also the plugin allows to link Conan profiles to the CLion ones, so you can change the settings of you build right from the IDE and have the
packages for your dependencies installed right away.

You can check all the details of the plugin and how to set it up in
["Getting Started with the Conan CLion Plugin"](https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2019/05/getting-started-with-the-conan-clion-plugin) posted
in the JetBrains Clion blog.

Happy coding!
