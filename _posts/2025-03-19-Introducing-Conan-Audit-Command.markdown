Maintaining a secure dependency graph and responding swiftly to security threats is
critical in modern software development. A recent example that underscores this need is
[the vulnerability discovered in XZ
Utils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor) (CVE-2024-3094). While this
vulnerability had the potential to affect many systems, it was detected before widespread
deployment, limiting its actual impact. This incident highlights the importance of
proactive security tools to help identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in dependencies.

At Conan, we have long considered security a priority, continuously implementing
features to enhance it. Some examples include native support for [generating SBOMs with
CycloneDX](https://blog.conan.io/2025/02/05/What-is-your-code-made-of-sboms.html) and
[package signing](https://docs.conan.io/2/reference/extensions/package_signing.html).

Building on this security-focused approach, we are excited to introduce a new experimental
command in Conan: `conan audit`. Starting with Conan 2.14, this command allows you to
check for potential CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) within your dependency
graph.

## Scanning for Vulnerabilities with `conan audit`

The `conan audit` command enables users to scan for potential vulnerabilities in any Conan
package available in Conan Center. This command connects to a free service powered by
[JFrog Advanced Security](https://jfrog.com/devops-native-security), which provides
detailed vulnerability analysis reports.

> **Note:** If you are using packages from Conan Center, some vulnerabilities may have already
> been mitigated through patches applied in the recipe. To verify if a patch has been
> applied, check the recipe in Conan Center.

To use the command, users must register and obtain a token that grants access to a limited
number of scans per day.

### Registering for the Service

Before using `conan audit`, you need to sign up for the free service. Upon registration, you
will receive a token that must be validated via email.

To register, go to [https://audit.conan.io/register](https://audit.conan.io/register) and
fill in your details.

</p>

> **Notes:**  
> - The `conan audit` service is currently in an experimental phase and may undergo
>   breaking changes in its APIs, results, and functionality.  
> - To ensure fair usage and prevent abuse, there is a limit of **100 queries per day**,
>   which resets every 24 hours.  

After registration, you will receive a token. Please make sure to store it securely as it
will only be displayed once.

<p class="centered">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/post_images/2025-03-19/conan-audit-token.png" alt="Conan Audit Token"/>
</p>

Next, you will receive an email to validate your token. Once validated, you can start
using `conan audit`.

</p>

### Using the `conan audit` Command

The first thing you need to do is update the security provider token for Conan Center. Do
this by running:

```shell  
$ conan audit provider auth conancenter --token=<your_token>
Provider authentication added.
```

> **Note:** We use `--token` for simplicity, but this may expose your token in shell
> history. To avoid this, set it as an environment variable matching the provider name in
> uppercase, e.g., `CONAN_AUDIT_PROVIDER_TOKEN_CONANCENTER`.

Once this is done, you're ready to scan for vulnerabilities in your Conan packages. The
simplest way to check a specific package reference is by using `conan audit list` like
this:
 
```shell  
$ conan audit list openssl/1.1.1w
Requesting vulnerability info for: openssl/1.1.1w

To scan the entire dependency graph of a Conan recipe, use the `conan audit scan` command
and provide the path to the `conanfile`, just as you would with other Conan commands. This
command calculates the graph based on the specified profiles, taking all transitive
dependencies into account. For instance, if a Conan recipe depends on `libpng/1.5.30` and
`openssl/1.1.1w`, running an audit on the recipe would produce a result similar to this:


```shell  
$ conan audit scan .
```

You will see something similar to this:

</p>

The `conan audit scan` command supports different output formats, allowing you to generate
results in JSON for programmatic analysis or in HTML for a more detailed visual report.

```shell  
$ conan audit scan . --format=html > report.html
```  

Now open `report.html` to view the detailed results of the vulnerabilities found,
presented in a searchable table.
