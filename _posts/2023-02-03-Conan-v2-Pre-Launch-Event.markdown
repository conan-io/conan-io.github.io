Excited for Conan 2.0? The pre-launch event will take place on February 10th ahead of the planned release on the 21st. That’s right, **February 21st, 2023** is the 2.0 Release.

To register for the webinar, [fill in this form](https://leap.jfrog.com/WN-Bin-2023-02-What-New-Conan-2.0-Lessons-C-Plus-Plus-Ecosystem-Global-LP.html), JFrog’s forms require a “company name” but just put conan for that if you prefer.

We also kicked off a “Tip of the Week” series, make sure to follow us on Twitter [@conan_io](https://twitter.com/conan_io).

#### Progress Report

- The team has been super hard at work putting the final touches on. [1.58](https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/tag/1.58.0) and [beta9](https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta9) just dropped so we are in the final stretch. Keep the feedback coming.
- Looking at some of the GitHub activity stats we’ve been seeing a more consistent rate for new pull request ConanCenterIndex, which is super exciting  - if you know the “time to merge” chart it is up by over 10 days. We should be getting back to normal as more resources are freed up.
