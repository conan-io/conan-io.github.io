I"º<p>Back in <a href="https://blog.conan.io/2018/10/11/New-conan-release-1-8.html">Conan 1.8 blog post</a> release, we introduced a so-called
‚ÄúPlugin System‚Äù. Reading some of the feedback from users we soon realized that although it was a very useful feature, it wasn‚Äôt exactly a
plugin mechanism. Normally such a mechanism is something more general and powerful that replaces or complements the functionality of a tool
in a wider way.</p>
