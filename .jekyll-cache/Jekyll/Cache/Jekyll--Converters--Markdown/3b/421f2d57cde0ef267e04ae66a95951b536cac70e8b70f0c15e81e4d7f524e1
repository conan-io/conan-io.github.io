I"ÿ<p>Summer holidays came to an end and we are back with a new Conan release. We have performed huge internal refactoring clearing the path to
accommodate a number of the most requested features. Here is the summary:</p>

<h2 id="introducing-the-python-requires">Introducing the Python requires</h2>

<p>One of our <a href="https://github.com/conan-io/conan/issues/1271">most requested features</a> is now alive in this release. Python requires improve
the usability of Python code across multiple recipes to enable the possibility of subclassing a ConanFile and reusing it as a Conan
dependency.</p>

<p>This how a recipe using python requires looks like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>from conans import python_requires

base = python_requires("MyBase/0.1@user/channel")

class PkgTest(base.MyBase):
    pass
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see itâ€™s as easy as importing the new python_requires module and using it  globally to require a reference of a Python recipe.</p>

<p>There is also the possibility of just reusing functions without subclassing a ConanFile:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>from conans import ConanFile, python_requires

base = python_requires("MyBuild/0.1@user/channel")

class PkgTest(ConanFile):
    ...
    def build(self):
        base.my_build(self.settings)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This has been released as an <strong>experimental feature</strong> so feedback is really welcome. For more information, please read the
<a href="https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/mastering/python_requires.html#python-requires">updated documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="support-for-python-37">Support for Python 3.7</h2>

<p>Following the <a href="https://blog.conan.io/2018/08/13/Its-Time-To-Deprecate-Python-2.html">deprecation notice of Python 2.7</a>, we have added
support for <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/">Python 3.7</a> in this release. This should work on all supported platforms
with the current Conan requirements. Test it out and if it is not the case, please report it in the issue tracker.</p>

<h2 id="scm-improvements-and-fixes-following-your-feedback">SCM Improvements and Fixes Following Your Feedback</h2>

<p>The SCM feature released in <a href="https://blog.conan.io/2018/05/30/New-conan-release-1-4.html">Conan 1.4</a> is getting a lot traction and we
continue improving it thanks to the feedback and users contributions.</p>

<p>Now SCM copies the <em>.git</em> folder similar to <code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone</code> and initializes submodules correctly after checking out the referenced revision
rather than to the default <code class="highlighter-rouge">*HEAD*</code> immediately following cloning.</p>

<p>There is also SVN support in development that will be available in the next release.</p>

<h2 id="other-usability-enhancements">Other Usability Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You can now filter the uploads with the query parameter: <code class="highlighter-rouge">conan upload --query</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of  enhancements have been added to the MSBuild build helper. You can now run builds in parallel and set the right toolchain for
x86 architectures. A new parameter has been added to include custom properties like <code class="highlighter-rouge">/p:MyCustomProperty=true</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Version ranges resolution speed has been improved by caching remote requests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The CMake generator now manages the C++20 flag.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
