I"‘<p>Thanks to our amazing community we can release a first version of the
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=conan-io.conan-vs-extension">Conan Extension for Visual Studio</a>.
It‚Äôs been a team effort of several people, we have to mention SSE4, ForNeVer, solvingj and
sboulema, but many others have contributed providing feedback, reporting early issues and
testing the first versions (<a href="https://github.com/conan-io/conan-vs-extension/graphs/contributors">all contributors</a>).
Thanks to all of them today we have an usable version we want
to endorse and share with the rest of our users.</p>

<p>This extension provides smooth integration between Conan and your Visual Studio project. It
will detect a <code class="highlighter-rouge">conanfile.py</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">conanfile.txt</code> next to a project file (or in parent directory),
retrieve the requirements and generate the property sheet (<code class="highlighter-rouge">.props</code> file) with all the information
of the dependencies handled by Conan to be included in that project. The extension will also add
the property sheet automatically to the project.</p>

<h2 id="install-and-configure">Install and configure</h2>

<p>This first version we are releasing, <code class="highlighter-rouge">v1.0.x</code> has a very basic behaviour and configuration, but
it covers the most common use cases. Once you have Conan already installed in your system,
follow the next steps to get it working in your Visual Studio IDE (only version 2017 and
2019 are currently supported):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use the Extensions Manager of your IDE to find ‚ÄúConan Extension for Visual Studio‚Äù and click
the download button to install it. Alternatively you can go to the
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=conan-io.conan-vs-extension">marketplace</a>,
download de VSIX file and install it.</p>

    <p>You can leave the other options with the default values, it isn‚Äôt the aim of this blog post
to enter into those details, but you can read about them and many other features in the
<a href="https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/">Conan documentation</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="use-conan-extension-for-visual-studio">Use Conan Extension for Visual Studio</h2>

<p>To use this extension you will need a <code class="highlighter-rouge">conanfile.txt</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">conanfile.py</code> in your <strong>Visual Studio
project</strong> declaring the requirements of your project. Conan will download them from the configured
remotes (or build them if binaries are not available), the extension will generate the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.props</code>
file and it will automatically included it in your project with all the paths and flags needed
to use and link against those required libraries.</p>

<p>Conan will detect the configuration used in your build to select the proper settings for the
requirements, so if you change build type from <code class="highlighter-rouge">Debug</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Release</code>, the toolset or runtime,
Conan will use the proper settings and flags to retrieve or build the matching binaries.
The output window shows all the information printed by Conan related to the executed command.</p>
