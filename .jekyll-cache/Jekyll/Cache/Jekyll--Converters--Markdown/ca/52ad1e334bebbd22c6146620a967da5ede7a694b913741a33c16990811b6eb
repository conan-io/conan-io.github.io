I"8<p>This post makes a brief introduction to the C++ modules (we wished C++17, but we will have to
wait). Modules have already been experimentally available in an early implementation in CLang, and now Microsoft is also
providing them in Visual Studio 2015. We will see their syntax and how to build them, as introduced in the 
<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2015/12/03/c-modules-in-vs-2015-update-1/">Visual Studio Blog</a>, and at the same time, we will show how to create
and consumes packages with C++ modules with conan C/C++ package manager.</p>
