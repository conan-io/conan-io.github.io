I";<p>Packaging C/C++ is not very difficult, as long as you have a well known, documented, relatively portable build setup for your library.

Thus, creating binary packages from sources, in a portable manner, for someone whoâ€™s not savvy with their build system, is challenging, just because building it is challenging.</p>
