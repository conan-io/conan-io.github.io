I"…<p>Conan is a free and open source (FOSS) project that implements a C and C++ package manager, consisting in a user side application and a server, that can be run anywhere, as the system is decentralized. We are running at <strong>conan.io</strong> a server instance as a convenience repository where users can read and write their own packages without having to run their own server.</p>
