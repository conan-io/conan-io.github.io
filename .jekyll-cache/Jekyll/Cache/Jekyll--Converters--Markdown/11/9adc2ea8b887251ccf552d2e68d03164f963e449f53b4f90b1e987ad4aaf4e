I"õ<p>Conan 1.5 was <a href="https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/changelog.html#id2">released last week</a> with some progress in features announced for 1.4.
This release is not so full of features but there are still some great new things to share!</p>

<h2 id="binaries-from-different-remotes">Binaries from different remotes</h2>

<p>Introduced some releases ago, <code class="highlighter-rouge">conan search &lt;pkg_pattern&gt; --remote all</code> is a very handy command when it comes to perform a search of a
reference in all remotes. Thanks to the contributors now you can also search for binaries in all remotes in the same way:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$ conan search &lt;pkg-ref&gt; -r=all</code></p>

<p>As this is quite useful to know in which remote are exactly the binaries you need, this feature would not be completed if you were not able
to mix binaries from different remotes. So this is exactly what we did:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ conan install libwebp/1.0.0@bincrafters/stable

<h2 id="build-requirements-in-dependency-graph">Build requirements in dependency graph</h2>

<p>After a huge refactor of the dependency graph now you can see <code class="highlighter-rouge">build_requires</code> represented in it. This feature is visible in
<code class="highlighter-rouge">conan info --graph</code> (represented in colors).</p>

<p class="centered">
    <img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/post_images/2018-07-06/graph.png" align="center" width="600" alt="Conan graph with build requires" />
</p>

<p>With these changes, <code class="highlighter-rouge">conan install</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">conan info</code> commands now show extended information of the both recipe‚Äôs and binaries‚Äô status in
the output:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>...
libwebp/1.0.0@bincrafters/stable: Installing package

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Dependency declaration order in recipes is respected too (as long as it doesn‚Äôt break the dependency graph order).</p>

<h2 id="scm-improvements">SCM improvements</h2>

<p>After a lot of new issues with feedback for the new SCM feature, we worked on some improvements to make it better. There is now a new <code class="highlighter-rouge">submodule</code> argument to <a href="https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/attributes.html?highlight=scm#scm">recursively clone submodules</a>.</p>

<p>Now you can also use <code class="highlighter-rouge">exports</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">exports_sources</code> together with <code class="highlighter-rouge">scm</code> attribute. <code class="highlighter-rouge">conan create</code> will copy exports and export sources first, then it will apply SCM and finally the <code class="highlighter-rouge">source()</code> method (in case you want to use the latest for patching for example).</p>

<p>This will also manage symlinks and, while developing locally, the <em>gitignored</em> files won‚Äôt be copied from the local repository.</p>

<p>Please keep the feedback coming!</p>
